				<img alt="Katse dam" src="lesotho.jpg" height="196" width="320">
				<p>This majestic landscape is found in Lesotho - a South African landlocked country situated in the southern part of Africa </p>
				<p>It was completed in 1996. It is recognised to be one of Africa's tallest dam with the height of 185meters. The dam happens to be one of South Africa's main water supply thus earning the country millions per year. The dam also benefits the country in the production of electricity via turning the turbines through the use of the concentrated water currents thus making electricity through one of the many methods called hydro-electricity</p>

				<p>Where else if not the great United States of America can you expect to find such wonders?</p>
				<p>Ah yes! the Grand Canyon, one of mother natures' greatest creations and wonders</p>
				<p>The Grand Canyon is part of the Colorado River basin, which has developed over the past 70 million years. For more than 150 years, scientists have gathered data, proposed new ideas, and debated sometimes contentious theories about the geologic origins of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. Formation of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River may involve a complex history in which multiple factors and geologic processes have interacted over time and in different locations.</p>

				<p>Yes, The Great Wall of China, one of China's biggest pride.</p>
				<p>Besides, the pyramids, this is also one of mankind's greatest architectural achievements</p>
				<p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
